[![N|Solid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Touqeer-tqr/slide-selector/master/vendor/assets/images/range-selector.png)]()

## Details
Sample app about how to create custom input tags for form
custom input tag that adds range slider with selector in which you can also enter text and slider will auto adjust.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'slide-selector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install slide-selector

## Usage

Rename applitcation.css to applitcation.scss and add `@import "slide-selector.css";`
In applitcation.js add `//= require slide-selector` after `//= require_tree .`

Some examples of using this tag
With form:
```
<%= form_for root_path do |f| %>
  <%= f.slide_selector [:min_rank, :max_rank], [0, 100], drop_down_options_dollar, type: 'amount', selector: false, slider_step: 5 %>
  <br><br>
  <%= f.slide_selector [:min_rank2, :max_rank2], [0, 10000], drop_down_options %>
<% end %>
```
Without form:
```
<%= slide_selector_tag [:min_rank3, :max_rank3], [0, 10000], drop_down_options %>
```

In application_helper.rb
```
module ApplicationHelper
  def drop_down_options
    {"$0.01" => 1, "$0.50" => 50, "$1" => 100, "$2" => 200, "$3" => 300, "$4" => 400, "$5" => 500, "$10" => 1000, "$15" => 1500, "$25" => 2500, "$50" => 5000, "$75" => 7500, "$100" => 10000}
  end
  def drop_down_options2
    {"1" => 1, "50" => 50, "100" => 100, "200" => 200, "300" => 300, "400" => 400, "500" => 500, "1000" => 1000, "1500" => 1500, "2500" => 2500, "5000" => 5000, "7500" => 7500, "10000" => 10000}
  end
end
```
